# ASD_NONNA_ALBERTA_project

this was a project to put into practice what we learned in the Algorithms and data structures course (unitn - A.Montresor)

- [curse page](https://cricca.disi.unitn.it/montresor/teaching/asd/)
- [text](prog2.testo.pdf)
- [solution](solution.cpp)

## My group made **99.24** pts using this logic:
- F = number of strings (Fili)
- G = number of clews (Gomitoli)

### cross counting
- Data structure: Fenwick tree
- Complexity: O(F*log(G))

### Brute force
- Random swap

### Heuristics
- Mean
- Median
- Range limit for random swaps
